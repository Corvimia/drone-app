Remember for repo operations:
- Base branch is always main.
- Remote is always origin.
- Branch name should follow Conventional Commits (https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
- When I say "go back to main", you should check out main, pull from latest.
- When I say "raise the pr", you should commit, push and raise a PR.
- When I say "start a new task" you should go back to main, then ask me about the task, create a branch (using Conventional Commits) and then start the task.
- When I say [remember] that mean you have to add it to the agents.md
- Always number your questions, so that they are easier to answer
